The current plan for the project is to create simple game based on fighting a human body.

It is a turn based game in which an enemy 'fires' at the player, and based on a random
probability, the player sustains damage. Each body part when hit will cause a certain amount
of damage to the player. The player continues until they lose all of their health points.

There will be multiple objects utilizing both parent and child classes.

Currently,

BODY-PART will be a parent object with leg, arm, head and torso child classes.

It will show clear and common use of arrays, strings, classes,
cin, cout, inheritance, polymorphism, abstract and virtual classes,
testing inputs vs expected outputs and regression testing.
